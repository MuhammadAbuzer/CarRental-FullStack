## 📌 About  

This project was developed by **Abuzer** as part of learning and practicing the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack**.  
It showcases the implementation of a **full-stack web application** with features such as:  

- User authentication and authorization  
- Role-based access (including an admin dashboard)  
- Real-world application workflows and best practices  

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in designing and developing scalable, maintainable, and production-ready web applications using the MERN stack.
